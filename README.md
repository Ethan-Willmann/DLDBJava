# Driver's License Database
This project is a simple driver's license database with a basic GUI that allows users to input and store license plate data. It was developed as part of a class to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java and introduce basic GUI programming.

## Overview
The application allows users to input license plate data, checks its validity, and stores it in a file. It accepts license plate numbers from Kansas or Missouri and ensures they follow the correct state-specific formats.

This project was made for a class to demonstrate my programming skills. It is not intended for editing.

## How It Works
* _User Input:_ Users enter license plate information into text fields.
* _Validation:_ The program checks whether the license plate follows the correct format for Kansas or Missouri and whether it has already been entered.
* _Error Handling:_ If the data is invalid, a message will notify the user of the issue and display the correct format for the license plate.
* _Data Storage:_ If valid, the license plate is stored as an object and written to a file.
* _Display Data:_ Users can print the list of all entered license plates by clicking the "Print List" button.

## Features
* GUI for user interaction
* Validation for state-specific license plate formats (Kansas and Missouri)
* Error messages for incorrect input
* Stores valid license plate data in a file
* Ability to print all stored data

## Purpose
This project was developed as part of an assignment to test my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in Java and to demonstrate my ability to create basic GUI applications.

## Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK)
