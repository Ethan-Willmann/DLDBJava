Driver's License Database
This project is a simple driver's license database with a basic GUI that allows users to input and store license plate data. It was developed as part of a class to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java and introduce basic GUI programming.

Overview
The application allows users to input license plate data, checks its validity, and stores it in a file. It accepts license plate numbers from Kansas or Missouri and ensures they follow the correct state-specific formats.

This project was developed for educational purposes and as a demonstration of my programming skills. It is not intended for public contributions.

How It Works
User Input: Users enter license plate information into text fields.
Validation: The program checks whether the license plate:
Follows the correct format for Kansas or Missouri.
Has already been entered.
Error Handling: If the data is invalid, a message will notify the user of the issue and display the correct format for the license plate.
Data Storage: If valid, the license plate is stored as an object and written to a file.
Display Data: Users can print the list of all entered license plates by clicking the "Print List" button.
Features
GUI for user interaction
Validation for state-specific license plate formats (Kansas and Missouri)
Error messages for incorrect input
Stores valid license plate data in a file
Ability to print all stored data
Purpose
This project was developed as part of an assignment to test my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming in Java and to demonstrate my ability to create basic GUI applications.

Note: This project is provided for demonstration purposes only and is not open for contributions or modifications.
